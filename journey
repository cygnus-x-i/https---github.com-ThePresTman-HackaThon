The major features of this project are the accessibility of AI through SMS messaging, allowing easy access to a chatbot,
and the use of AI to aid in suicide and self harm prevention.  It was designed by 3 people who got very little sleep.  
Most of our problems came from the SMS service, SignalWire.  We went through many different SMS services before landing 
on SignalWire.  Most of these services are meant for companies sending out mass messages, so it isn't perfect for our use
case. It still isn't working perfectly, only allowing verified numbers to access the program, but we were able to get a
prototype after many iterations of the code.  Improvements we could make in the future are our own SMS service so we 
don't have to jump through these hoops, allowing anyone to access our assisstant for free at any time.
