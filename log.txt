- Grilling chicken breasts or thighs usually takes about 6 to 8 minutes per side over medium-high heat.
- Baking chicken breasts or thighs at 375ï¿½F (190ï¿½C) usually takes about 20 to 30 minutes.
- Cooking chicken in a slow cooker usually takes about 4 to 6 hours on low or 2 to 3 hours on high.

How long does it take to cook chicken
Message out:
The cooking time for chicken will vary depending on the cut of meat and the cooking method used. Here are some general guidelines:

- Boneless, skinless chicken breasts: These can be cooked in a skillet or oven in about 15-20 minutes.
- Bone-in chicken pieces (such as thighs or drumsticks): These will take longer to cook, usually around 25-30 minutes in the oven or on the grill.
- Whole chicken: A whole chicken will take about 1-1.5 hours to cook in the oven at 375ï¿½F (190ï¿½C).

It's important to always use a meat thermometer to ensure that the chicken has reached a safe internal temperature of 165ï¿½F (74ï¿½C) before serving.

The cooking time for chicken varies depending on the cooking method and the cut of chicken being cooked. Here are some general guidelines for cooking times:

1. Roasting a whole chicken at 350ï¿½F (175ï¿½C) typically takes about 20 minutes per pound, so a 4-pound chicken would take approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes to cook.
2. Grilling or baking chicken breasts generally takes about 20-25 minutes at 375ï¿½F (190ï¿½C).
3. Pan-searing chicken thighs or drumsticks usually takes about 10-12 minutes per side over medium-high heat.
4. Cooking chicken in a slow cooker on low heat can take anywhere from 4-8 hours, depending on the recipe and the size of the chicken pieces.

It is important to always check the internal temperature of chicken using a meat thermometer to ensure it reaches a safe temperature of 165ï¿½F (74ï¿½C) before consuming.
